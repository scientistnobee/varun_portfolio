description_of_the_project = "The overarching goal of COSY-BIO is to develop a theoretical framework and innovative technological tools to engineer reliable biological systems that are robust despite their individual components being not by translating principles of control engineering to molecular and cell biology.\n\nMy role within this project is to develop a supervisory algorithm for integrating video microscopy, microfluidics and optimal experimental design / parameter estimation to update model of a network of interest and design inputs optimised to refine the model."
